I’m \*\*Chris Lee, PE, PMP\*\* — a structural engineer focused on \*\*risk-informed practice\*\*, \*\*hazard-aware design\*\*, and \*\*infrastructure resilience\*\*.



My work spans structural design review, field assessments, and delivery support in complex project environments. I’m especially interested in how engineering evidence (performance, uncertainty, fragility, consequence) can better inform planning, governance, and investment decisions.



\*\*Current focus areas\*\*

\- Performance-based / risk-informed structural engineering  

\- Earthquake hazard \& loss thinking  

\- Data-driven assessment of civil infrastructure systems  

\- Translating technical evidence into decisions (policy, capital planning, adaptation)



\*\*Credentials\*\*

\- Professional Engineer: CA, NJ  

\- PMP | LEED Green Associate
